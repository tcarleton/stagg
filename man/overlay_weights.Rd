\title{Find the spatial overlap between a raster and a set of polygons}
\usage{
overlay_weights(
  polygons,
  polygon_id_col,
  grid = era5_grid,
  secondary_weights = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{polygons}{a simple features polygon or multipolygon object}

\item{polygon_id_col}{the name of a column in the \code{polygons} object with a
unique identifier for each polygon}

\item{grid}{a raster layer with the same spatial resolution as the data}

\item{secondary_weights}{an optional table of secondary weights, output from
the \code{secondary_weights()} function}
}
\value{
a data.table of area weights and possibly secondary weights for each
cell within each polygon
}
\description{
The \code{overlay_weights()} function generates a table of weights mapping
each grid cell to its respective polygon(s) for use in the \verb{staggregate_*()}
family of functions.
}

                               # county identifiers

                           # (cropland_world_2015_era5 is available to the
