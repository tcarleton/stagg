# Introduction
This vignette demonstrates how to use the `stagg` package with data from `climateR`, as well as other data sources that do not have temporal metadata in a format that `stagg` accepts in the layer names. 

First, we load the packages used in this vignette. 
```{r eval=FALSE}
library(climateR) # Obtain climate data
library(tigris) # Polygons to request and aggregate climate data over
library(stagg) # Aggregate the climate data
```

# climateR example: Working with GridMET Data

The `climateR` package provides access to data from various sources, such as `GridMET` or `CHIRPS`. 

The raster layer names for data retrieved from `climateR`, like that of `ERA5` data, are compatible with `stagg` and therefore can be used without any additional steps. Specifically, the layer name format compatible with `stagg` uses a `character-date-time` or `character-date format` following a string header, or the start date-time and temporal time steps of the raster stack must be specified in `staggregate_*()`. For example, `ERA5` uses the format `x2021.01.01.00.00.00` `or x2021.01.01`, and data retrieved using `climateR` uses the format `variable_2021-01-01`. 

## Load New Jersey Counties
First, we load the county boundaries for New Jersey using the `tigris` package.

```{r}
nj_counties <- tigris::counties("NJ")
```

## Retrieve GridMET Data
Next, we use the `climateR` package to retrieve precipitation data from `GridMET` for New Jersey counties for the year 2010.

```{r}
gridmet_pr <- climateR::getGridMET(
  AOI = nj_counties,
  varname = "pr",
  startDate = "2010-01-01",
  endDate  = "2010-12-31"
)[[1]] |>  
  raster::stack()
```

We can print the layer names to ensure their compatibility with `stagg`. 

```{r}
names(gridmet_pr[[1:3]]) # Print the first three layer names
```


## Calculate Overlay Weights
We calculate overlay weights for the New Jersey counties using the retrieved GridMET data.

```{r}
county_weights <- stagg::overlay_weights(
  polygons = nj_counties,       # Simple features object with the desired polygons
  polygon_id_col = "COUNTYFP",  # Column name containing polygon identifiers
  grid = gridmet_pr             # Raster layer with the same coordinate system and spatial resolution as the climate data
)

print(county_weights, digits = 4)
```

## Perform Polynomial Aggregation
We perform polynomial aggregation on the GridMET data using the calculated overlay weights.

```{r}
polynomial_output <- stagg::staggregate_polynomial(
  
  data = gridmet_pr,                # The GridMET data retrived from ClimateR
  
  overlay_weights = county_weights, # Weights for grid cells within each county 
                                    # in New Jersey
  
  daily_agg = "none",               # Because climateR provides data at the 
                                    # daily level already, it is not necessary
                                    # to aggregate it up. If it were finer and
                                    # we did want to aggregate it, we would 
                                    # choose "sum" since we would want the sum 
                                    # of precipitation over the time_agg of 
                                    # choice. 
  
  time_agg = "month",               # The temporal level to aggregate daily 
                                    # transformed values to. Current options are 
                                    # "hour", day", "month", and "year". Note 
                                    # that "hour" is only available if daily_agg
                                    # is set to "none"
  
  degree = 3                        # The highest order of the polynomial. Here 
                                    # this will create variable 3 columns: 
                                    # order_1, order_2, and order_3
  )

polynomial_output
```

# Using data from any source using manual time specification

Other data types with layer names that do not follow the `stagg` naming convention can also be used with stagg by specifying the start date and time interval of the data when calling `staggregate_*()`. 

First, we rename all the layers to a format not compatible with `stagg`.
```{r}
names(gridmet_pr) <- rep(NA, length(names(gridmet_pr)))
names(gridmet_pr[[1:3]]) # Print the first three layer names
```

We can still use staggregate in the same way as above and get the same output, but simply have to manually specify the `start_date` and `time_interval` of the data we are using. 
```{r}
polynomial_output <- stagg::staggregate_polynomial(
  
  data = gridmet_pr,                # The GridMET data retrived from ClimateR, 
                                    # but with NA layer names
  
  overlay_weights = county_weights, 
  
  daily_agg = "none",           
  
  time_agg = "month",       
  
  start_date = "2010-01-01",        # Our data starts on January 1, 2010
  
  time_interval = "1 day",          # Our data has a time interval of one day
  
  degree = 3
  )
```

The new output is identical to the one obtained above. 

```{r}
polynomial_output
```
